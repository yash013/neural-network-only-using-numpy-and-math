# Neural Network from Scratch (Numpy and Math)

This repository contains an implementation of a simple neural network using only numpy and basic mathematical operations. The goal is to demonstrate the fundamental concepts behind neural networks without relying on external libraries like tensorflow and keras.

## Features

- Feedforward neural network architecture
- Backpropagation for training
- Relu activation function
- gradient descent
